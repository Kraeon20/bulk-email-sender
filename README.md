<h1>#bulk-email-sender</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The Email Bomber is a Python program designed to send a large number of emails in a bulk fashion. It allows you to specify the target email address, the number of emails to be sent, the email server to be used, and various other options. Please use this program responsibly and only with the explicit consent of the recipients.

<h2>Note:</h2>
This program is intended for educational and learning purposes only. Sending unsolicited or spam emails is illegal and unethical.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
To run the Email Bomber program, you need to have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org

<h2>Usage</h2>
Download the Email Bomber script.
Place the message.txt file in the same directory as the script. This file should contain the content of the email you want to send. Each time an email is sent, the program will read the content from this file and include it in the email.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script using the command: python email_bomber.py
Features
Bulk email sending to a specified target email address.
Multiple bombing modes: 1000, 500, 250, or custom amount (user-defined).
Supports Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, and custom email servers.
Customizable sender name, subject, and email content.
Warning
The misuse of this program can lead to legal consequences and damage to your reputation. Do not use this program for malicious or harmful purposes. Only use it with explicit permission from the recipients.

<h2>How to Use</h2>
When you run the script, it will display the program banner and prompt you to enter the target email address.
Choose a bombing mode from 1, 2, 3, or 4. These correspond to 1000, 500, 250, or a custom number of emails, respectively.
Enter the email server (1 for Gmail, 2 for Yahoo, 3 for Outlook, or provide the server name and port number manually).
Provide the from address (your email address) and password for authentication.
Enter the subject and the name of the sender (you can use any name).
If you have not done so already, create a message.txt file containing the email content in the same directory as the script.
The program will then initialize the attack, asking you to specify the number of threads to use and the sleep time between starting new threads.
Confirm if you want to start sending emails.
The program will start sending emails, and you will see a progress bar showing the status of the attack.
